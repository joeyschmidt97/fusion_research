#This script will get the filepath for several simulations and check that they agree among the simulations





# Introduce a function that checks if the filepath a parameters file has agrees with current simulations
# If it doesn't agree give other filepaths to change diagdir to and check parameters to see if they agree
# Also give the option to override and run simulation anyways
